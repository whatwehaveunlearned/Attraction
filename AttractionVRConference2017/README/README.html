    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The VR template is a
        simple "Hello World" program to get started developing for
        SteamVR using Unity3D. It is primarily targeted for the HTC Vive
        but it should work with Oculus once they release their 3D
        controllers.<br>
      </font> </p>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">To use it simply open
        the folder from within Unity3D. It will open up to a scene that
        appears somewhat like what you see below.<br>
        The positioning of some of the windows will be different
        depending on how you have configured your Unity work space.<br>

    <h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Running the App</font></h3>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> To run it, simple PLAY
      your Unity app.<br>
      <br>
      Once started you can do the following:<br>
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Navigation</b>:
          You can navigate around the space by using your "left" wand
          controller (on the HTC Vive) and using the DPAD. Lightly
          touching the DPAD forward, will move you forward, touching
          back will move you backward. The further out at the extremity
          of the DPAD you touch the faster the walk speed. The DIRECTION
          of walk is determined by your wand's VECTOR- i.e. the
          direction you are pointing the wand. To TURN in the
          environment, you TURN your physical body. This technique for
          navigation is not familiar to those raised on first-person
          shooters but it is a "standard" among VR pioneers who
          developed applications (in the early 1990s) before
          first-person-shooters came out. The physical turning of the
          body is designed to help reduce nausea problems that is
          especially prevalent in head-mounted displays. When walking
          around you are also subject to gravity, which means you can
          potentially walk up inclines and fall off. Navigation uses
          Unity's standard physics constraints&nbsp; so when you
          encounter some objects you may topple them over, whereas some
          objects (kinematic) will not let you walk through them at all.
          Lastly, to reset your position back to the center of the
          world, press the TRIGGER beneath your index finger.<br>
        </font> </li>
      <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Object
            Manipulatio</b><b>n</b>: With the "right" wand controller
          (the one shown with the orange sphere around it), you can pick
          up objects in the scene and move them around. To pick
          something up press and hold the TRIGGER on the controller. To
          release the object release the trigger. Some objects will fall
          under gravity while some objects are set up to be kinematic,
          meaning they will freeze in place once you let go. No you
          cannot throw an object. That's homework for you to work on.<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>360 Image Capture</b>:
          To take a 360 photo of your VR world (such as the one below),
          press the O key. If you want to snapshot something that is
          also stereoscopic 3D, press the P key. Lastly if you want to
          do successive snaps to try to make a movie, press the I key.
          Press the I key again to stop recording. Note: capturing
          individual frames for a movie is extremely slow. The captured
          images are stored in a folder called LSCaptureFiles.
          Additional instructions on what to do with the files can be
          found <a href="CaptureInstructions.pdf">here</a>. In a <a

        Template program already has the SteamVR plugin installed. It is
        in the SteamVR asset folder. The package is also already
        incorporated into the demo scene. They appear under [CameraRig].

          series</a> is worth watching as it will give you an
        understanding of the basic steps needed to work with SteamVR.
        Note: in order to understand this video you will need to already
        know something about working with Unity3D. There are numerous
        tutorials online for that.<br>
      </font></p>
    <img alt="" src="img2.png" height="453" width="319"><br>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">However, in a nutshell:
        The SteamVR camera rig shown above in the Unity scene hierarchy
        as [CameraRig] consists of 2 Controllers (the wands of the HTC
        Vive) and a Camera (head). There are two Geometry Objects called
        Model that are attached to left and right controllers. When made
        active they show the Vive's controllers in the virtual world. If
        you choose to make then inactive they will simply not appear.
        That said, any object attached as a child of one of the
        controllers will go along for the ride. So for example you could
        attach a 3D model of a hand to one of the controller and the
        hand will track with the controllers in the virtual world. Note,
        in the example above there is a Geometry Object called Grabber.
        This is simply the orange sphere in the demo. Associated with it
        is a Unity collider and a Grabber script. As explained in more
        detail below, this essentially turns the Grabber object into
        something that you can use to pick up and manipulate virtual
        objects. Whenever you intersect the sphere with an object you
        are essentially in range to pick that object up. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you want to find out
        how to access the various buttons on the Vive's controllers keep
        reading- there is a script called Control that gives examples of
        the code you need to make that work.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Lastly there is the
        Camera (head). This is your tracked head in the virtual
        environment. If you attached a Geometry Object to the head it
        will also go along for the ride. For example, if you wanted to
        implement a heads-up display with text in it, you would attach
        that to the head.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Notice there is also a
        LS360VRCameraRig. This is NOT part of the standard SteamVR
        package. This is a separate add-on that allows you to capture
        360 images of your VR environment. This is discussed further
        below.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In this VR Template
        there are three scripts: Navigate, Control and Grabber. The
        Navigate and Control scripts can be found as components of
        [Camera Rig]. Navigate is what does the movement in the VR
        world. The demo is setup to use the left wand controller. You
        can easily modify it to use the right controller. By default
        navigation is constrained to the horizontal plane. If you want
        to also be able to move up and down simply uncheck the box that
        says: Disable Vertical Motion. You can also change the maximum
        navigation speed by changing the value in the box: Walk Speed.
        The default is 10.<br>
      </font> </p>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The Control script does
        nothing useful except give you sample code that demonstrates how
        to use all the wand controller buttons. When you try pressing
        them all it does is print something to the console window. It is
        best to understand the code to apply it to your own application
        needs.<br>
      </font> </p>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The grabber script is
        what does the object manipulation. In the demo it is added to a
        Grabber game object (a sphere) that is parented under the Right
        controller. You can modify this to use your own game object as
        well as configure it to use a different wand, etc. The way the
        grabber script works is that whenever your sphere is colliding
        with an object it takes that object and parents it under the
        wand. That way when you move your wand the grabbed object comes
        along for the ride. When you finally let go of the object, the
        grabber script returns that object to its original hierarchy in
        the Unity scene.<br>
      </font></p>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Last but not least
        there is a 360VRCameraRig parented to [Camera Rig]. This is what
        does the 360 image capture. It has its own script which you can
        examine if you wish under the 360VRCameraCaptureRig asset
        folder. Here are <a href="CaptureInstructions.pdf">instructions
        </a>that came with this asset. Here is the original <a
          href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#%21/content/53264">source




        </a>of the asset.&nbsp; I modified this script slightly so that
        it would place its camera at the same location of your tracked
        head so that all snapshots are taken from your point of view.<br>
      </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Lastly<br>
      </font> </h3>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">All the other objects
        in the world can be modified, incorporated into other codes, or
        discarded at will. If you want to write your own navigation or
        grabber script feel free to do so. This world is just meant to
        get you started. A good way to start is to simply put in some 3D
        objects of your own and walking around them or pick them up. <br>
